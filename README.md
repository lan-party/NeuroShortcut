## Frequency Band Thresholding
Triggers are built up from training to modulate activity in different regions of thr brain and in different frequency bands. [Learn more here](https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/04/15/5-types-of-brain-waves-frequencies-gamma-beta-alpha-theta-delta/)
Control methods based on motor imagery and sensory evoked potentials will be added at some point.
